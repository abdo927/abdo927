         <h1>Hi Abdelrahman</h1>
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am Tapajyoti Bose, a Cross Platform Developer (specializing in Front End Web Development) pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science & Engineering. I enjoy contributing to Open Source Projects and am really enthusiastic about learning new technology.</p>
      <p>In 2020, I learnt Django, Electron, Flutter. React and TypeScript. in 2021 till now, I learnt Next.js. SASS Progressive Web App (PWA) and a bit about Three.js. I also got started with freelancing and blogging recently.</p>
      <p>Outside the world of tech too. I love pushing myself to develop new skills ranging from guitar, break dancing, sketching, touch typing to some whacky ones like writing with my left hand (only aiming from mastery only in guitar and dancing though).</p>
      <p>I love reading books on personal development & financial literacy. My favourites ones are The Compound Effect by Darren Hardy in the genre of personal development and Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki in the genre of financial literacy.</p>
