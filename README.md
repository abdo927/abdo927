    <p>
      I am a Computer Science & Engineering student and a Cross-Platform Developer
      with a strong focus on Front-End Web Development and Cybersecurity.
      I am passionate about building secure, scalable applications and continuously
      improving my technical skills.
    </p>

    <p>
      I started my journey in web design and development in 2022, and in 2023 I
      strengthened my front-end skills by learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap,
      Angular, and TypeScript. Alongside development, I developed a deep interest
      in cybersecurity and system-level technologies.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have hands-on experience with Python (including basic scripting and small projects),
      Windows system administration concepts, Linux fundamentals, and Bash scripting.
      I also have a solid understanding of networking and security fundamentals,
      including Network+ and Security+ concepts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recently, I have been expanding my backend development skills using C#, SQL,
      LINQ, database design concepts (ERD), and backend architecture fundamentals.
      My goal is to combine development and security knowledge to build robust and
      secure systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond technology, I enjoy challenging myself physically and mentally through
      gym training, MMA, swimming, table tennis, and competitive gaming.
      I am also an avid reader with a strong interest in personal development
      and financial literacy.
